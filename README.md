# Todo List Odoo18

## About the module
This is a custom **Todo List** module for the Odoo ERP system. Developed as a practical project to demonstrate real-world use of Python and Odoo's framework, the module provides an internal task management system where users can create, assign, and track personal or collaborative to-do items. It supports tagging, user participation, real-time progress tracking, and is designed for internal users with full CRUD permissions.

## How to use and what you need
* This module is intended to be used within an existing Odoo installation.
* The **`__manifest__.py`** file defines the metadata and module dependencies.
* Key components:
   * **Models**: Define Todo Lists, Tasks, Tags, and Users.
   * **Views**: Provide form and list views with workflow buttons.
   * **Security**: Custom access groups and permissions for internal users.

* To install and use this module:
   * **Clone the repository** into your Odoo `addons` directory.
   * **Restart Odoo** and activate developer mode.
   * **Update the apps list** and install `Todo List` from the Apps menu.

## Basic usage
1. Log in as an internal user.
2. Go to the **"Todo List"** menu in the top navigation.
3. Use the **"All / Uncomplete / Complete"** submenus to filter the list.
4. Create a new Todo List and fill in the required fields (title, start date, end date).
5. Add participants and tasks directly from the form view.
6. Click **Start Progress** to begin the workflow, and **Done** when all tasks are completed.

## Introduction to the module
This module was built to provide a clean and extendable internal to-do management system for Odoo users. It showcases proper use of Odoo models, views, security, computed fields, and workflow buttons. The structure follows Odoo development standards and can be extended with additional logic such as email notifications or task deadlines.
